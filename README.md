- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin, also known as @groovyninja0324
- 👀 I am new to the coding world and I have not found what I am interested in currently.  I can however, say that I am excited to learn all that I can while I am in school and put my best foot forward.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code from the beginning and my main language that I will be focusing on will be Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone that focuses on Python, as that will be my main focus through school.
- 📫 I can be reached through Github, Discord at .groovyninja or my email at theurbancowboy324@gmail.com
